                    <h1>Welcome to Corgi!</h1>
                    <p>Corgis are the royalty that rises above the rest of the canine nobility of the world. From their
                        short statures to their vibrant coats, they are truly perfection personified. The author cannot
                        say they know this from personal experience due the unfortunate affliction of allergic asthma,
                        but the superiority of corgis is not something one confirms with their own experiences, but is a
                        fact that they know, in their hearts.</p>
                    <p>On this humble memorial to the majesty of the elegant corgi, you will find a quiz to prove your
                        competency of existing within the same multiverse as corgis, as well as other wonderful
                        corgi-related things. Consult the navigation bar above for more.</p>
